## Vision
The Open Roberta Lab is **the** platform to program robots and other interresting things, like microcontrollers or industrial robot arms.

## How to
* Support many different interresting robot systems.
* Provide the necessary features for teacher, kids and parents to make the programming experience as intuitive and successful as possible.

## 2017
For this year we will focus on integrating more robot systems, especially arduino based robots and providing additional support for teachers, like managing groups. Also we would like to maintain and improve the already existing robot systems.

## Wishlist
We have a wishlist https://github.com/OpenRoberta/robertalab/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22wish+list%22, it is a collection of ideas and wishes. Once we decide to work on one of the issues, it moves to the according milestone.
