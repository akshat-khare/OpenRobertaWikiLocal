Base on the experience so far with USB Connection program there is a need of a new software that is connecting a local device with the current local browser session. 

* connect to the OR Lab using a token, which can be generated both on the server side or robot connector program
   1. Entering the token by typing (current procedure) 
   2. Robot connector program creates a link with a token, so when user clicks on the links it opens the OR lab in a browser already paired with a token
