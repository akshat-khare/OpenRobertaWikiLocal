We want to make it easy for our users and contributors to get in touch with us and connect with each other, to make the Open Roberta Lab better and better. Here are the main channels we're running currently, we'd love to hear from you on one of them:

## Google Group

[Open Roberta Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-roberta)

The Open Roberta Google Group is a good first stop for a general inquiry about the Open Roberta Lab. It's also a good forum for discussions about the roadmap or potential new functionality.

##IRC

`#open-roberta`

We are using the IRC channel `#open-roberta` on Freenode for our developer group. Feel free to join the group.

## GitHub

[Open Roberta Issues](https://github.com/OpenRoberta/robertalab/issues)

If you spot a bug, then please raise an issue in our main GitHub project (OpenRoberta/robertalab); likewise if you have developed a cool new feature or improvement in your Snowplow fork, then send us a pull request!

If you want to brainstorm a potential new feature, then the Open Roberta Google Group (see above) is probably a better place to start.
