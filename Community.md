We want to make it super-easy for our users and contributors to talk to us and connect with each other, to share ideas, solve problems and help make Snowplow awesome. Here are the main channels we're running currently, we'd love to hear from you on one of them:

## Google Group

[Open Roberta Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-roberta)

The Open Roberta Google Group is a good first stop for a general inquiry about the Open Roberta Lab. It's also a good forum for discussions about the roadmap or potential new functionality.

##IRC
