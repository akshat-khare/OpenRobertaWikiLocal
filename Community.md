We want to make it super-easy for Snowplow users and contributors to talk to us and connect with each other, to share ideas, solve problems and help make Snowplow awesome. Here are the main channels we're running currently, we'd love to hear from you on one of them:

## Google Group

[Open Roberta Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-roberta)

The Open Roberta Google Group is a good first stop for a general inquiry about the Open Roberta Lab. It's also a good forum for discussions about the roadmap or potential new functionality.

IRC

#snowplow

We're big fans of IRC here at Snowplow. We have a #snowplow channel on Freenode - stop by and say hi, you can even use Freenode's webchat service so don't need to install anything to access it. Soon, this channel will be linked to our GitHub - so you can see new issues, merged pull requests and so on as they happen.

Twitter

@SnowplowData

Follow and chat to us on Twitter.

GitHub

Snowplow issues

If you spot a bug, then please raise an issue in our main GitHub project (snowplow/snowplow); likewise if you have developed a cool new feature or improvement in your Snowplow fork, then send us a pull request!

If you want to brainstorm a potential new feature, then the Snowplow Google Group (see above) is probably a better place to start.

Email

community@snowplowanalytics.com

If you want to talk directly to us (e.g. about a commercially sensitive issue), email is the easiest way.
