### Why
A lot of people, teachers and students, around the world have no good internet connection or other good reasons not to use our online Server at [https://lab.open-roberta.org](https://lab.open-roberta.org). This tutorial explains how to setup the server on lokal system, either as standalone version (not recommended), or as local network installation, e.g. in classrooms or maybe in a school or intranet network (sorry, no real experience in this).

You can install the Open Roberta Lab on several different systems. We recommend to install it on a linux system like ubunto, which is easy, but depending on what you want to use also windows can be an alternative. Unfortunatly Mac OS X is not a good choise because you probably run into problems with java 8, if you want to generate code for ev3lejos. So please read carefully what you have to install besides the Open Roberta Lab, maybe you don't need all of this.
